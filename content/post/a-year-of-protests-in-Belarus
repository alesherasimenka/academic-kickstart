title: 2017 - a year of protests in Belarus
summary: 2017 witnessed one of the most widespread and successful anti-government protests in Belarus since its independence. People flooded the streets of at least 17 cities. Some of these cities did not experience this kind of mobilisation for 20 years or more. This year, two campaigns attracted the significant numbers of attendants and attention of the public. They are the Anti-tax protest movement and the Kurapaty defence movement. In this article, I will show in what way and why these two protest waves were unusual for Belarus and to what implications for the country they led.
